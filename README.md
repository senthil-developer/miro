# Miro Clone

This is a Miro clone built using Next.js, LiveBlock, Convex, and Clerk. Miro is a collaborative online whiteboard platform where teams can ideate, collaborate, and brainstorm in real-time. This project aims to replicate some of the key features of Miro while leveraging modern web development technologies.

## Features

- **Real-time Collaboration**: Multiple users can collaborate on the same whiteboard in real-time.
- **Drawing Tools**: Basic drawing tools such as pen, shapes, and text are available for users to express their ideas.
- **Drag and Drop**: Users can drag and drop elements on the canvas to arrange them as needed.
- **Authentication**: User authentication is handled using Clerk, providing secure and customizable authentication flows.
- **LiveBlock Integration**: LiveBlock enables real-time updates to the whiteboard, ensuring smooth collaboration.
- **Convex Integration**: Convex is used for realtime database+backend.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: Next.js is a React framework for building server-side rendered and statically generated applications.
- **LiveBlock**: LiveBlock is a real-time collaboration platform that provides the infrastructure for enabling collaborative features in web applications.
- **Convex**: Convex is the fullstack TypeScript development platform.
  Replace your database, server functions and glue code.
- **Clerk**: Clerk is an authentication and user management service that provides pre-built UI components and secure authentication flows.

   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=your_NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL
   ```

   Replace `YOUR_KEY` with your actual API keys.

4. Run the development server:
